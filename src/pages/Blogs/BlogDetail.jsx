              Music is not just entertainment. It’s an emotion, a feeling, and a
              powerful way of expression. It is a form of art that breaks all
              barriers and brings people together. Technically speaking, music
              is a medley of beats, tunes, and sometimes lyrics, all composed
              together in a symphony. While in songs, you might understand the
              lyrics sometimes but the rhythm and the beats can make you fall in
              love with it. Since music holds such importance in the world we
              live in today, many people seek to get a thorough knowledge about
              it. Following the notion, in 2015 the music school Rhymicstan was
              founded. The music school in the south extension offers
              full-fledged music education from Classical to Western.
